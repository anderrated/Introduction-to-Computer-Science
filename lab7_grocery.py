A mother wants to list down the things she needs to buy, however, she needs a simple list that be run 
every time and can be modified whenever she changes her mind.

Starting with just an empty list, write a function that creates a grocery list that does the following:
• Add an Item (takes a string input from the user and add it to the existing list)
• Remove an Item (takes a string input from the user and removes all instances from the list)
• Print entire list (prints out all the contents of the list)
• Exit (exit the program)
